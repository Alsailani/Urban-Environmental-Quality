# Urban-Environmental-Quality

## Objective/Motivation
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive database system that records both indoor and outdoor air quality data, as well as thermal comfort data. This information will empower building occupants to identify the most favorable locations within the premises. Additionally, the system will issue alerts in the event of unfavourable conditions. Over time, the accumulated data will assist in addressing and mitigating environmental quality issues. Data loggers will continuously feed information into this database system.


## Multiple Relations
The database will contain a variety of relational data sets. For instance, weather stations will log external climate information. Outdoor sensors will record wind speeds to evaluate pedestrian wind comfort levels. Additionally, data from indoor sensors will be recorded. A significant correlation is expected between indoor and outdoor conditions.

## Platforms
I will use MySQL database hosted on FreeDB.net for my data storage needs. FreeDB.net offers a dependable and cost-free solution for data storage. For the design phase, I will use MySQL Workbench due to its intuitive graphical features. As the project is still in its developmental stage, a more advanced hosting solution doesn't seem necessary at the moment. However, post-testing, I may consider transitioning to real-time data collection hosted on AWS.

## Learning Objective and Outcomes
As an Architectural Engineer, I am very passionate about enhancing thermal comfort and air quality in built environments. In this project, I am excited to improve my skills in designing a top-notch database system â€“ a journey I am eager to continue even after this course. This project complexity is above our usual labs. I will be diving into tools like MySQL Workbench for design, which will surely boost my expertise. Down the road, I am looking at Python for data logging with SQLAlchemy. In addition, I will dive deep into data analysis to understand insights from the data.Looking forward to using this project in real buildings after completion.
